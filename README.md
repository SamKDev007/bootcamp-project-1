## Description
At Skippers Transport, the traditional onboarding process was time-consuming, resource-intensive, and occasionally prone to errors. Facing these challenges, our team saw an opportunity to revolutionize their employee induction experience through technology. 

The motivation behind developing the Skippers Transport Online Induction System was to create an accessible, centralized platform that enables smooth, standardized, and engaging onboarding for new hires and existing employees.
Currently there is no induction content. The whole induction comprises of a questionaries that doesn’t have any content for. New employees are expected to answer the questions without having access to any relevant information that the users can learn from.

There is existing developed inductions designed for visitors and other people entering the main facility in Welshpool. This new induction system is designed to integrate seamlessly into the existing system and be more detailed and tailored to employed workers.
